# Project Codes

This is a TextExpander snippet that is designed to create a new project code with the project title collected on run. It will add a line to `project-codes.md` located in a notes directory defined within the script and create a new `.md` file in the directory. This is designed to work with nvAlt or nvUltra in a way that creates wiki links back to the project text file from `project-codes.md`.

# Setup

All you need to do is tell it where you want to save the files. Change this line:

`set notesDirectory to "/Users/USERNAME/notes/"`

Copy and paste it into [TextExpander](https://joebuhlig.com/go/textexpander) and you're all set.

# Development

I'm certainly open to the submission of Pull Requests to make this better. If you find issues and fix them, please let me know and I'll be happy to update and give you credit.
